## Depth First Search (DFS) Visualizer

Depth First Search is a graph algorithm which is used to travel the graph.

This algorithm takes a root node(here it is last cell in maze).

I have visualized the depth first search to a maze problem. 

## Requirements
- Python
- pyamaze module
- Dfs algorithm

## Maze problem:
- It has a starting point at last row, last cell in maze .
- From this point, we should move to ending point which is at first row, first cell in maze.
- Here, through DFS we can move in 4 directions(North, South, East, West).



## Creating Maze

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyamaze.

```bash
pip install pyamze
```

## Maze


## Final output
